## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Banking Management System** implemented in Python, featuring:
- Creation and management of **major (adult)** and **minor (child)** bank accounts.
- Hierarchical data structure using **Linked Lists** and **AVL Trees**.
- Bank operations including **deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer**, and **transaction history**.
